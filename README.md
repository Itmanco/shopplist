# Shoophon

This project implements a portable shopping list app that allows the user to take note of most of the common product information and keep track of some basic calculations on the list of products like the quantity of items and balance.
Also allows the owner of a list to share it with other users already registered in the web application.
The project was implemented using Django 5.0.3
